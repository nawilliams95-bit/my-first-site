        <!-- MISSION -->
        <section class="about-section">
          <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
          <p>
            Realty Data Labs exists to make real estate data easier to understand,
            more transparent, and more useful for everyday decision making.
            The platform is designed to aggregate market signals, historical trends,
            and economic indicators into tools that help users think clearly about
            property and housing markets.
          </p>
          <p>
            We focus on education and analysis. We do not replace professional advice,
            and we do not attempt to predict outcomes. Our goal is to provide context,
            not conclusions.
